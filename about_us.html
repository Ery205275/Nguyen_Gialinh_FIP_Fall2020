					<h2>About Ginger</h2>
					<p> My name is Ginger. I am a 2 years old Siamese mixed cat. My hobby is meowing during my mom' sleeping time until she gets up and chases me. My previous owner had to leave Canada so i was staying at her friend's house for a while until my mom came to pick me up with a blue cage. I sniffed to realize that the cage is belonged to another cat which means I will have friend. I soon learned that the other cat was a grumpy old lady but it is okay because I love my family.</p>

				<h2 align="right">About Fish-sauce</h2>
					<p align="right"> My name is Fish sauce...well my previous owner called me Poll.. I am a 9 years old Calico cat. My hobby is running out of our house as fast as I can so mom will play tag with me. I love to eat. My old owner weren't always home so she left a lot of foods for me everyday. I might look grumpy and actually a little grumpy but I really love to have a lot of people around me. At my old house, there was another cat that always bullied me for food but now I bully Ginger.</p>

				<h2 align="right">About me</h2>
					<p align="right"> Hi, Iâ€™m Gia Linh. Previously a dog lover, I became a full-time mommy of 2 cats and commission cosplayer during quarantine time. I used to stay in a homestay with 2 dogs and I love them to death but I couldn't stay forever because I have to moved away for college. I couldn't stand the feelings of being alone so I adopted 2 guinea pigs first then my 2 devil cats now. I came to Canada alone when I was in grade 9 and I have to admit that I was lonely before I have this family.</p>

					<h2>Our Guinea Pigs</h2>
					<p> Just because I made a website about my cats doesn't mean I don't love my little piggies. They were my first pets and they scared of everything. But now all they do is sleep, eat and squeeking for more foods. I love to talk about how chubby they are now but I feel like people might feel bored. The yellow one is Kar, the brown one is Ma (what a beautiful name for both). Ma loves to have a bath since her fur is longer and easy to get dirty. Kar loves to squeek for food 24/7 and she hates bathing.</p>
