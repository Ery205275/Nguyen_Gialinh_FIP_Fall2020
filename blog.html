				<h3>Why do cats sleep a lot?</h3>
					<p> Normally cats sleep an average of 15 hours per days. My Ginger probably sleeps 20 hours and spends last 4 hours to meow. Cats sleep to conserve energy. Sure, other fur-covered mammals coast by on 8 hours of sleep per cycle, but cats may sleep to help regulate body temperature, as well as for pleasure.  Wild cats need to sleep in order to conserve their energy to hunt, chase and kill their next meal. Although our house cats may not need to hunt, the instinct to sleep and prepare for the hunt carries on.</p>

				<h3>My cat thinks that I am annoying</h3>
					<p> Since I stay home a lot more often than before, Fish sauce is getting grumpier every time she sees me. a lot people probably has seen a video of a cat yelling at owner for being home too long. Well Fish-sauce isn't that sassy but I noticed that she glanced at me with death in her eyes and she signed a lot when I do something that bothers her. Oh well, It is not my fault that covid is still going on. By the way, here is the link to that yelling cat's video: https://www.cnn.com/videos/us/2020/03/18/coronavirus-home-self-isolation-quarantine-cat-not-happy-mxp-vpx.hln </p>

				<h3>A cat is marking her territory</h3>
					<p> I just moved in with my boyfriend and Fish sauce started laying dead everywhere. She rubs her body to every inch of the floor. When cats rub against objects, they are transferring their scent. It is almost as if they are claiming ownership and we are one of their belongings. Your cat head-butting or nuzzling your face deposits scent from glands in their cheek area. I think my cat is now in love with our new apartment's floor.</p>

				<h3>Ginger and his weird obsession</h3>
					<p>I think every household who has cats will feel familiar with this situation. I know for a reason that some cats may enjoy drinking from the toilet is the water in there actually tastes fresh and the water in the toilet may have more oxygen in it from recent flushing. But I changed his water bowl 3 times per day. Maybe he just love staying in the toilet. Sometime when I am in there, he also scratchs the door and asks to come in with me too. It's so weird lol.  </p>
